4. Select your unit from the dropdown
5. Click **"Set Calibration"**

**Tips for Accurate Calibration:**
- Use horizontal or vertical dimension lines when possible
- Choose points that are far apart for better precision
- Zoom in when clicking calibration points
- Use dimension lines already marked on your drawing
- Verify your calibration with a test measurement

### Method 2: Scale Presets (Fastest)

Perfect when you know your drawing's scale:

1. Click the **"Calibrate Scale"** button
2. Click **"Use Scale Preset"**
3. Choose from available scales:

**Imperial Scales:**

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Scale Regions

**When to Use:**
- Drawings with detail callouts at different scales
- Site plans with enlarged area details
- Mixed-scale construction documents
- Floor plans with zoomed sections

**How to Set Up:**
1. Click **"Add Scale Region"**
2. Draw a polygon around the first scale area
   - Click points to outline the region boundary
3. Click **"Complete Region"**
4. Calibrate the scale for this region
   - Either draw calibration line or use preset
5. Repeat for each different scale area

**How It Works:**
- MeasureMint automatically detects which region you're measuring in
- Applies the correct scale based on measurement location
- No need to manually switch scales
- Measure freely across the entire drawing

**Example:**
- Main floor plan at 1/4" = 1'-0"
- Kitchen detail at 1/2" = 1'-0"
- Define two scale regions
- Measure anywhere - scale applied automatically

### Feet-Inches Display Format

**Automatic for Construction Professionals:**

When measuring in feet, MeasureMint automatically displays results in feet-inches format rounded to the nearest inch:

**Standard Format:**
- Input: 12.5 feet
- Display: "12' 6""

- Input: 20.75 feet
- Display: "20' 9""

- Input: 8 feet
- Display: "8' 0""

**Why Feet-Inches?**
- Industry standard for construction
- Matches dimension callouts on drawings
- Easier for contractor communication
- Aligns with tape measure readings

**Rounding:**
- Automatically rounds to nearest inch
- Provides construction-practical accuracy
- Example: 12.458333 ft → 12' 6" (not 12' 5.5")

## Understanding Measurements

### Calibration Persistence
- Each calibration applies to all subsequent measurements
- Recalibrate anytime to change scale
- Previous measurements retain their original calibration
- Best practice: Note calibration reference on board

### Unit Flexibility
- Change units on any measurement after creation
- Each measurement can use different units
- Conversions are automatic and precise
- Imperial ↔ Metric conversion available

### Measurement Accuracy
- Accuracy depends on calibration quality
- Use longest possible calibration distance
- Zoom in for precise point clicking
- Verify with known dimensions

## Tips for Accurate Measurements

### Calibration Best Practices

1. **Choose Good Reference Distance**
   - Use the longest dimension available on drawing
   - Horizontal or vertical lines are easiest
   - Use dimension lines already on the drawing
   - Avoid diagonal or angled references when possible

2. **Precise Point Placement**
   - Zoom in before clicking calibration points
   - Click exactly on dimension line endpoints
   - Use clear, unambiguous points
   - Double-check your reference distance value

3. **Verify Calibration**
   - Take a test measurement on a known dimension
   - Compare result to drawing dimension
   - Recalibrate if test shows inaccuracy
   - Document your calibration reference

### Measurement Best Practices

1. **Point Placement**
   - Zoom in before clicking measurement points
   - Click carefully on exact locations
   - Use consistent reference planes
   - Be precise with corners and intersections

2. **Organization**
   - Group related measurements together
   - Use frames or notes to label measurement groups
   - Color-code different measurement types
   - Keep calibration references visible

3. **Complex Shapes**
   - Use more points for curved or irregular shapes
   - Break complex areas into simpler shapes
   - Use cutout tool for areas with openings
   - Verify totals match expectations

### Tool-Specific Tips

**Area Measurements:**
- Click around perimeter in order (clockwise or counter-clockwise)
- More points = better accuracy for curved spaces
- For L-shaped rooms, can break into rectangles or use one polygon

**Polyline:**
- Use more points for curved paths
- Straight segments can use fewer points
- Perfect for following utilities on plans

**Volume:**
- Ensure height unit matches your needs
- Remember: Area × Height = Volume
- Good for concrete, excavation, fill calculations

**Cutout Areas:**
- Draw main area first completely
- Add all cutouts before finalizing
- Can add multiple cutouts for windows, doors, etc.
- Verify gross area before adding cutouts

**Slope:**
- Measure horizontal distance on plan
- Enter actual vertical rise
- Get three formats simultaneously
- Use appropriate format for your discipline

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Measurements Seem Inaccurate

**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect calibration distance entered
- Points not precisely placed
- Wrong units selected
- Measuring on different scale area

**Solutions:**
- Verify calibration reference distance
- Recalibrate using longer reference distance
- Zoom in for precise point placement
- Check that you're in correct scale region
- Take test measurement on known dimension

### 2. Can't Click Points Accurately

**Solutions:**
- Zoom in more before clicking
- Ensure drawing is clear and not blurry
- Check that image is fully loaded

- Verify app is loaded completely
- Try clicking tool button again

### 4. Multi-Point Tool Not Completing

**Solutions:**
- Look for "Complete Area" or "Complete Polyline" button
- Must click completion button to finish
- Cancel and restart if needed
- Ensure at least minimum points clicked (3 for area/polygon)

### 5. Units Are Wrong

**Solutions:**
- Click unit dropdown on measurement
- Select desired unit
- Check calibration units
- Verify unit system (Imperial vs Metric)
- Remember: feet displays as feet-inches automatically

### 6. Export Not Working

**Solutions:**
- Ensure measurements exist before exporting
- Check browser pop-up blocker
- Verify CSV download permissions
- Try exporting again
- Check downloads folder

### 7. Scale Regions Not Detected

**Solutions:**
- Ensure region polygon is complete
- Verify measurement point is inside region boundary
