## Quick Start

1. **Select your image or PDF**
   - Click on the image or PDF on your Miro board
   - Only one item can be selected at a time

2. **Calibrate**
   - Click the "Calibrate" button
   - Click two points on your image that represent a known distance
   - Enter the actual distance between these points
   - Choose your preferred unit of measurement

3. **Measure**
   - Click the "Measure" button
   - Click your start point
   - Click your end point
   - The measurement will appear on the board

## Understanding Measurements

Each measurement you make is independent and includes:
- The distance in your chosen unit
- A line showing the measured distance
- A label with the measurement value

### Important Notes

- Each measurement remembers its own calibration
- You can recalibrate at any time without affecting existing measurements
- Different measurements can use different units
- You can switch between metric and imperial units at any time

## Tips for Accurate Measurements

1. **Calibration**
   - Use the largest possible distance for calibration
   - Choose points that are easy to identify
   - Make sure you know the exact distance between calibration points
   - Consider adding a note on the board about your calibration reference

2. **Making Measurements**
   - Zoom in for precise point placement
   - Click carefully on exact points
   - Use consistent reference planes
   - Group related measurements together

3. **Organization**
   - Add notes to explain measurements
   - Use different colors for different types of measurements
   - Keep calibration references visible on the board
   - Group related measurements together

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Measurements seem inaccurate**
   - Check your calibration distance
   - Verify you're measuring in the same plane
   - Make sure points are precisely placed
   - Consider recalibrating with a larger reference distance

2. **Can't select points accurately**
   - Zoom in for better precision
   - Make sure you're clicking on the image/PDF
   - Try repositioning your view
   - Check that the image is fully loaded

3. **Units are wrong**
   - Click the unit button to change units
   - Verify calibration units
   - Check measurement units
   - Remember each measurement can use different units
