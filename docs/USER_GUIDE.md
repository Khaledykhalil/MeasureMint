### For Accuracy:

1. **Use longest available reference** - Longer calibration distances = higher accuracy**Real-World Examples:**

2. **Zoom in when clicking** - Precise point placement is critical

3. **Use dimension lines** - Already-marked dimensions are ideal calibration references**Roof Pitch:**

4. **Verify with test measurement** - Measure a known dimension after calibrating- Horizontal run: 30 feet

5. **Calibrate each axis separately** if drawing appears distorted- Height change: 10 feet

- Result: 4:12 pitch (common residential)

### For Efficiency:

1. **Reuse existing lines** - Faster than drawing new calibration lines**ADA Ramp:**

2. **Keep measurements on board** - Visual reference for future work- Horizontal run: 30 feet

3. **Use appropriate units** - Match your industry standards (ft for architecture, mm for engineering)- Height change: 2.5 feet

4. **Update rather than recalibrate** - Faster to adjust values than start over- Result: 8.33% slope (meets 1:12 = 8.33% max requirement)



### For Complex Drawings:**Road Grade:**

1. **Start with overall calibration** - Use a large dimension for initial calibration- Horizontal distance: 1,000 feet

2. **Test in multiple locations** - Verify calibration works across the entire drawing- Elevation change: 50 feet

3. **Use dual-axis if needed** - Don't fight distorted images- Result: 5% grade

4. **Document your calibration** - Note which reference you used

**Tips:**

## Keyboard Shortcuts- Use Rise:Run for roofing (4:12, 6:12, etc.)

- Use Percentage for ADA compliance (max 8.33%)

Currently, all interactions are mouse/touch-based. Keyboard shortcuts may be added in future versions.- Use Degrees for general slope reference

- All three formats shown simultaneously
