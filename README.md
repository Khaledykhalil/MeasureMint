### üìê Measurement Tools

#### 1. **Linear Distance** 
Click two points to measure straight-line distance. Perfect for dimensions, diagonals, and direct measurements.

#### 2. **Area & Perimeter**
Click multiple points to define a polygon. Get both area and perimeter measurements instantly. Ideal for rooms, lots, or any bounded space.

#### 3. **Polyline Length**
Measure complex paths by clicking multiple points. Total length is calculated along the entire path. Essential for roads, piping, or winding routes.

#### 4. **Count Tool**
Click to place counting markers on the board. Keep track of items like fixtures, columns, or repeated elements.

#### 5. **Volume Calculation**
Define a polygon area and specify height to calculate volume. Perfect for concrete pours, excavation, or material estimates.

#### 6. **Angle Measurement**
Click three points to measure angles. Displays in degrees with full 360¬∞ range. Essential for slopes, intersections, and alignments.

#### 7. **Circle Measurements**
Click center and edge to get radius, diameter, circumference, and area. Perfect for circular features like columns or roundabouts.

#### 8. **Cutout/Subtract Areas** ‚≠ê
Calculate net areas by subtracting openings from main areas. Define a main polygon, then click "Add Cutout" to subtract windows, doors, or other openings. Shows gross area, total cutouts, and net area (Gross - Cutouts = Net).

#### 9. **Slope/Pitch Tool** ‚≠ê
Click two points and enter height change to get:
- **Rise:Run ratio** (e.g., 4:12 for roofing)
- **Percentage** (e.g., 33.3% for roads)
- **Degrees** (e.g., 18.4¬∞ for ramps)

#### Feet-Inches Display
For imperial measurements in feet:
1. Take any measurement in feet
2. The display shows feet-inches format: "12' 6"" instead of "12.5 ft"

## ÔøΩ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OAuth Error: redirect_uri_mismatch**
   - Verify the redirect URI in your Miro app settings matches your .env file
   - Make sure you're using HTTPS when required
   - When using Docker, check the ngrok URL matches your Miro app settings

2. **Cannot find module 'xyz'**
   - In Docker: Run `npm run docker:dev` to rebuild with new dependencies
   - Local setup: Run `npm install`

### Docker-Specific Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   # Stop all running containers
   npm run docker:down
   
   # Remove any orphaned containers
   docker-compose down --remove-orphans
   ```

2. **Changes not reflecting**
   - Ensure your code is properly mounted in docker-compose.yml
   - Try rebuilding the containers: `npm run docker:dev`

3. **Database connectivity issues**
   - Check if the db volume is properly mounted
   - Verify permissions on the db directory
   - Ensure the database path in .env matches the Docker volume path

4. **Ngrok issues**
   - Verify your authtoken is correctly set in .env
   - Check the ngrok container logs: `docker-compose logs ngrok`
   - Try restarting the containers: `npm run docker:down && npm run docker:dev`
