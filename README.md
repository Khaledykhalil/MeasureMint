4. See the measurement displayed with a connecting line
5. Change units anytime using the unit dropdown

### Advanced Features

#### Update Calibration
Made a mistake or need to adjust? Click "Update Calibration" to:
- Change the reference distance
- Switch between units
- Modify which axis is calibrated
- No need to redraw your calibration line!

#### Dual-Axis Calibration
For distorted or stretched images:
1. Set X-axis calibration using a horizontal reference
2. Set Y-axis calibration using a vertical reference
3. MeasureMint automatically applies the correct scale based on measurement direction

### Switch Units Anytime
Change units without re-measuring:
1. Use the unit selector on any measurement
2. Choose from: ft, in, yd, mi, m, cm, mm, km
3. All measurements update automatically

### Performance

Performance utilities and monitoring:

```jsx
import { measureAsync, debounce, throttle, memoize } from '@/utils/performance';

// Measure operation performance
await measureAsync(async () => {
  // Your async operation
}, 'Operation Label');

// Debounce user input
const debouncedHandler = debounce(handleInput, 300);

// Throttle frequent events
const throttledHandler = throttle(handleScroll, 100);

// Memoize expensive calculations
const memoizedCalc = memoize(expensiveFunction);
```

See [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for detailed optimization guide.

## ÔøΩ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OAuth Error: redirect_uri_mismatch**
   - Verify the redirect URI in your Miro app settings matches your .env file
   - Make sure you're using HTTPS when required
   - When using Docker, check the ngrok URL matches your Miro app settings

2. **Cannot find module 'xyz'**
   - In Docker: Run `npm run docker:dev` to rebuild with new dependencies
   - Local setup: Run `npm install`

### Docker-Specific Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   # Stop all running containers
   npm run docker:down
   
   # Remove any orphaned containers
   docker-compose down --remove-orphans
   ```

2. **Changes not reflecting**
   - Ensure your code is properly mounted in docker-compose.yml
   - Try rebuilding the containers: `npm run docker:dev`

3. **Database connectivity issues**
   - Check if the db volume is properly mounted
   - Verify permissions on the db directory
   - Ensure the database path in .env matches the Docker volume path

4. **Ngrok issues**
   - Verify your authtoken is correctly set in .env
   - Check the ngrok container logs: `docker-compose logs ngrok`
   - Try restarting the containers: `npm run docker:down && npm run docker:dev`
